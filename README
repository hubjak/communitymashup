Install steps for the CommunityMashup Sync Tool:

0) If not already done, set up your Eclipse installation for using OSGi, EMF etc.
   as explained in [1]
   !!! ON WINDOWS, MAKE SURE THAT ECLIPSE IS USING UTF-8 GLOBALLY !!!
1) Extract the contents of the archive to an arbitrary directory
2) Open Eclipse and use the File > Import > "Existing Projects into Workspace" wizard.
   Select the directory you extracted the files to, enable nested search and check 
   all the entries found, then finish the wizard.
3) Visit [2] and and download the right SWT library for your OS (swt-****.zip)
4) Open the "Existing Projects into Workspace" wizard again, choose the 
   "archive file" option and select the downloaded swt-****.zip file, then finish
   the wizard.
5) Create a new OSGi Run Configuration as explained in [3], except:
   - Rather than FeedSourceService, select MediaTUMSourceService, MendeleySourceService
     and ResearchGateSourceService (or any other services you wish to use)
   - Furthermore, select the following projects: MashupSync, org.json, org.eclipse.swt
   - Replace demo.xml by your own configuration file or adjust the existing demo.xml
6) Run the configuration and wait until the CommunityMashup is ready
7) Start the sync tool by running org.sociotech.mashupsync.gui.GUIMain as a
   Java Application
