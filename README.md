===============

The CommunityMashup is an integration solution for social data. Its intention is to integrate data from different sources like social networking services in a person-centric manner. The CommunityMashup provides components and interfaces for the easy development of applications based on aggregated social data. Besides classical web applications, it aims at the development of mobile as well as desktop applications.
The technical solution of the CommunityMashup is based on a service oriented architecture that allows the flexible combination of reusable components into complex integration solutions. To face the integration challenges of heterogeneous systems the CommunityMashup is developed by a model driven approach. This allows the evolution of the internal used data model as well as to react on interface changes of used external services.
